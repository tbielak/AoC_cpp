-----------------

Solving __part one__ is pretty easy.

Let's use the following typedef to keep set of pairs of numbers, which are `(x, y)` coordinates of points reached on the map:

```C++
typedef set<pair<int, int>> t_points;
```

A method finding starting point looks like that:

```C++
t_points Main::starting_point(const vector<string>& input)
{
	t_points points;
	for (int y = 0; y < (int)input.size(); y++)
		for (int x = 0; x < (int)input[y].size(); x++)
			if (input[y][x] == 'S')
				points.insert(make_pair(x, y));

	return points;
}
```

Doing a single step transforms input set of `points` into `output` set of points, taking into account rocks `#` found on `input` map:

```C++
t_points Main::step(const vector<string>& input, const t_points& points)
{
	static vector<int> move_x = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
	static vector<int> move_y = { 1, 0, -1, 0 };

	t_points output;
	for (const auto& [px, py] : points)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		{
			int x = px + move_x[i];
			int y = py + move_y[i];
			if (x < 0 || x == (int)input[y].size() || y < 0 || y == (int)input.size())
				continue;

			if (input[y][x] != '#')
				output.insert(make_pair(x, y));
		}
	}

	return output;
}
```

Size of the set of `points` after 64 steps is the solution of part one:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	auto points = starting_point(input);
	for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++)
		points = step(input, points);

	return points.size();
}
```

-----------------

__Part two__ is tricky: introduces map repeating infinitely in every direction + high number of steps.

Let's do some observations:
- Map is a square: `11x11` for example input shown in problem description, `131x131` for my puzzle input.
- Both numbers (`11` and `131`) are prime, maybe it doesn't matter here, but brings to mind the concept of the existence of cycles that are multiples of these numbers.
- Both numbers (`11` and `131`) are odd to make possible to put starting point in the center of the map and... starting points are literally in the center of both maps.
- Both inputs have garden plots `.` around the map, making two rows/columns of `.` at the edges of adjacent copies of map.

Big map (the puzzle input) is more symetric than example map:
- Big map (`131x131`) has wide diagonal paths with no rocks `#` in a shape of a diamond, which (along with garden plots rows/colums at the edges of the map) keep high number of points in each copy of the map, which increases the likelihood of repeating patterns.
- Big map (`131x131`) has no rocks `#` in 65th row and 65th column. This row and this column is the shortest path to the edge of the map, so it means that new adjacent copies of the map (creating an infinite big map) should be attached every `65+k*131` steps.
- Last but not least: number of steps requested in part two is `26501365 = k*131+65` steps, where `k = 202300` (the year 2023 multiplied by 100 to make sure that noone receives the result in brute-force iterations).

The last three observations mentioned above lead me to abandon the example map and consider only the big map (the puzzle input).

__Note__: The final solution will be strongly based on assumptions derived from the above observations, example map will not be solvable!

-----------------

Let's check how many points are in each copies of the map (repeating infinitely) after `k*131+65` steps (when new adjacent copies of the map are attached to infinite map). See the following code:

```C++
auto points = starting_point(input);
int k = 0;
for (int i = 0; ; )
{
	points = step(input, points);
	i++;

	if (i == k * 131 + 65)
	{
		cout << "---- k=" << k << ":" << endl;
		for (int y = -k; y <= k; y++)
		{
			for (int x = -k; x <= k; x++)
			{
				int minx = x * 131;
				int maxx = minx + 131;
				int miny = y * 131;
				int maxy = miny + 131;

				int c = 0;
				for (const auto& [x, y] : points)
					if (x >= minx && x < maxx && y >= miny && y < maxy)
						c++;

				cout << c << "\t";
			}

			cout << endl;
		}

		k++;
	}
}
```

It is an infinite loop which every `k*131+65` step prints out a table showing how many points are in each copy of the map. It requires modified version of `step` from part one, propagating points outside the original map:

```C++
t_points Main::step(const vector<string>& input, const t_points& points)
{
	static vector<int> move_x = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
	static vector<int> move_y = { 1, 0, -1, 0 };

	t_points output;
	int size = (int)input.size();
	for (const auto& [px, py] : points)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		{
			int x = px + move_x[i];
			int y = py + move_y[i];
			if (input[(y + size * 1000) % size][(x + size * 1000) % size] != '#')
				output.insert(make_pair(x, y));
		}
	}

	return output;
}
```

__Note__: Adding `size * 1000` to `x` and `y` is the easiest way to get rid of negative numbers before the modulo operation, but it limits the correct execution of the method to `131*1000+65` steps (which is enough for the purpose of this experiment).

After 65 steps we reach to the edges of the original map with `3847` points on my input:

```
---- k=0:
3847
```

After 196 steps the original map has `7584` points, we reached to the outside edges of four other copies of the map (upper = `5690` points, left = `5686` points, right = `5684` points, bottom = `5680` points) and started filling the copies placed in the corners of the big map:

```
---- k=1:
967     5690    940
5686    7584    5684
968     5680    966
```

After 327 steps diamond pattern becomes visible and some numbers start to repeat. The number of points in the original map dropped down to `7523`, but four adjacent maps got `7584` points now. It seems that diamond pattern grows from the center to outside:

```
---- k=2:
0       967     5690    940     0
967     6601    7584    6612    940
5686    7584    7523    7584    5684
968     6608    7584    6595    966
0       968     5680    966     0
```

After 458 steps the growth pattern is clearly visible:

```
---- k=3:
0       0       967     5690    940     0       0
0       967     6601    7584    6612    940     0
967     6601    7584    7523    7584    6612    940
5686    7584    7523    7584    7523    7584    5684
968     6608    7584    7523    7584    6595    966
0       968     6608    7584    6595    966     0
0       0       968     5680    966     0       0
```

Let's take a look at the situation after 589 steps:

```
---- k=4:
0       0       0       967     5690    940     0       0       0
0       0       967     6601    7584    6612    940     0       0
0       967     6601    7584    7523    7584    6612    940     0
967     6601    7584    7523    7584    7523    7584    6612    940
5686    7584    7523    7584    7523    7584    7523    7584    5684
968     6608    7584    7523    7584    7523    7584    6595    966
0       968     6608    7584    7523    7584    6595    966     0
0       0       968     6608    7584    6595    966     0       0
0       0       0       968     5680    966     0       0       0
```

Of course, adding all these numbers is the solution we are looking for. However, we need a result for `k = 202300`, which is after `26501365` steps.

Fortunatelly, after `k = 2` there are no new numbers in the table. Let's multiply unique numbers by expected number of their occurrences, basing on print outs above:
- Numbers `5686`, `5690`, `5684` and `5680` appear once.
- Numbers `967`, `940`, `966` and `968` appear `k` times.
- Numbers `6601`, `6612`, `6595` and `6608` appear `k - 1` times.
- Number `7523` appears `(k - 1) * (k - 1)` times.
- Number `7584` appears `k * k` times.

So, we've got:

```C++
constexpr int64_t k = 202300LL;
constexpr int64_t result =
	5686LL + 5690LL + 5680LL + 5684LL +
	(967LL + 940LL + 968LL + 966LL) * k +
	(6601LL + 6612LL + 6608LL + 6595LL) * (k - 1) +
	7523LL * (k - 1) * (k - 1) +
	7584LL * (k * k);
```

And the result is `618261433219147`, which is correct solution for my input :)

-----------------

Taking into account all the observations and assumptions, here is the proposition of the solution of __part two__:

Generating points after `2*131+65 = 327` steps:

```C++
auto points = starting_point(input);
		
int k = 2;
int size = (int)input.size();
for (int i = 0; i < k * size + size / 2; i++)
	points = step(input, points);
```

Counting points in each copy of the map:

```C++
map<pair<int, int>, int64_t> count;
for (int y = -k; y <= k; y++)
	for (int x = -k; x <= k; x++)
	{
		int minx = x * size;
		int maxx = minx + size;
		int miny = y * size;
		int maxy = miny + size;

		int64_t c = 0;
		for (const auto& [x, y] : points)
			if (x >= minx && x < maxx && y >= miny && y < maxy)
				c++;

		count[make_pair(x, y)] = c;
	}
```

Counting points for `k = 202300`:

```C++
k = 26501365 / size;
return count[make_pair(-2, 0)] + count[make_pair(0, -2)] + count[make_pair(0, 2)] + count[make_pair(2, 0)] +
	(count[make_pair(-2, -1)] + count[make_pair(1, -2)] + count[make_pair(-1, 2)] + count[make_pair(1, 2)]) * k +
	(count[make_pair(-1, -1)] + count[make_pair(1, -1)] + count[make_pair(-1, 1)] + count[make_pair(1, 1)]) * (k - 1) +
	count[make_pair(0, 0)] * (k - 1) * (k - 1) +
	count[make_pair(0, 1)] * k * k;
```

Done! :-)

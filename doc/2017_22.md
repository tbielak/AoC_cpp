Quote from puzzle description:
>Diagnostics indicate that the local grid computing cluster has been contaminated with the Sporifica Virus. The grid computing cluster is a __seemingly-infinite two-dimensional__ grid of compute nodes. Each node is either __clean__ or __infected__ by the virus.
>
>Diagnostics have also provided a map of the node __infection status__ (your puzzle input). Clean nodes are shown as `.`; infected nodes are shown as `#`. This map only shows the center of the grid; there are many __more nodes beyond those shown__, but none of them are currently infected.

Here is my input (map of 25x25 nodes):
```

>The virus carrier begins __in the middle__ of the map facing __up__.

Then it turns right or left, infects or cleans the nodes depending on some conditions. In the part two of the puzzle there are four states of the node: __clean__, __weakened__, __infected__, __flagged__.

We need to keep two-dimensional positions of the virus carrier, and position of the nodes (in the map of the node infection status). First, let's define a simple class with `x` and `y` coordinates, useful constructor and `operator <`:

```C++
class Position
{
public:
	Position(int x = 0, int y = 0)
	:	x(x), y(y)
	{
	}

	bool operator < (const Position& rhs) const
	{
		return (x == rhs.x) ? y < rhs.y : x < rhs.x;
	}

	int x, y;
};
```

`operator <` is needed to keep deterministic order of elements in the following map:

```C++
// map: position-to-infection status
// infection status: clean = 0, weakened = 1, infected = 2, flagged = 3
typedef map<Position, int> t_infection_map;
```

This is the map of the node __infection status__. Single element is the position of the computer node in the grid (`Position`) and its infection status (`int`). Infection status could be defined as `enum` to be more descriptive, but keeping it as `int` simplifies switching to the next state, you'll see it later.

Let's define `Grid` class keeping map of the node infection status, able to load the map from input on constructor, and able to perform defined number of `steps` in `burst` for speficied `part` of puzzle solution:

```C++
class Grid
{
public:
	Grid(const vector<string>& input);
	int burst(int part, int steps);

private:
	t_infection_map _map;
};
```

Having such class allows to solve part one of the puzzle (with 10 thousands burst steps):

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return Grid(input).burst(1, 10000);
}
```

and part two of the puzzle (with 10 million burst steps):

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_two(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return Grid(input).burst(2, 10000000);
}
```

Let's take a look at the constructor to see how input is loaded:

```C++
Grid::Grid(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int size = (int)input.size();
	int center = size / 2;
	for (int y = 0; y < size; y++)
		for (int x = 0; x < size; x++)
			_map[Position(x - center, y - center)] = (input[y][x] == '#') ? 2 : 0;
}
```

We assume that input map is a __square__, so we can take its `size` from number of lines of input. We also assume that the size is __odd__, and the `center` is in `size / 2` column/row. Then, two `for` loops look at every node of the computers on the map, inserting `2` or `0` (node __infected__ or __clean__) in correct position of the `_map`. Position coordinates `x` and `y` are corrected by `center` value to assure that virus carrier will start at position `(0,0)`.

Finally, let's see how burst steps are made:

```C++
int Grid::burst(int part, int steps)
{
	static vector<int> acc_x = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
	static vector<int> acc_y = { -1, 0, 1, 0 };

	Position carrier;
	int facing = 0;	// 0 = up, 1 = right, 2 = down, 3 = left
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < steps; i++)
	{
		int infection_status = _map[carrier];
		facing = (facing + infection_status - 1) & 3;
		infection_status = (infection_status + (part ^ 3)) & 3;
		if (infection_status == 2)
			result++;

		_map[carrier] = infection_status;
		carrier.x += acc_x[facing];
		carrier.y += acc_y[facing];
	}

	return result;
}
```

Virus carrier starts at position `(0,0)`, facing __up__:

```C++
	Position carrier;
	int facing = 0;
```

`facing` could be defined as `enum` to be more descriptive, but keeping it as `int` simplifies its updates, you'll see it soon.

The main goal is to count __how many bursts cause a node to become infected__. We have to count such situations, starting with `0`:

```C++
	int result = 0;
```

Burst is counted when in current burst step the node __becomes infected__, meaning: when its new infection status becomes `2` in next consecutive steps. Finally, when bursts are done, we return this value:

```C++
	for (int i = 0; i < steps; i++)
	{
		...
		if (infection_status == 2)
			result++;
		...
	}

	return result;
```

In every burst step infection status of the node where virus carrier is positioned is taken from the map:

```C++
		int infection_status = _map[carrier];
```

Then, basing on infection status the carrier is rotated left or right, or it does not turn or reverses direction. In spite of the fact that the rules describing these changes are complex, it is done by this simple line:

```C++
		facing = (facing + infection_status - 1) & 3;
```

How it works? First, `infection_status - 1` gives: `-1` for __clean__ state, `0` for __weakened__ state, `1` for __infected__ state, `2` for __flagged__ state. Adding this value to __facing__ results in:
- turning left in __clean__ state (because decreasing `facing` value turns carrier left)
- no turn in __weakened__ state (adding zero changes nothing)
- turning right in __infected__ state (because increasing `facing` value turns carrier right)
- reversing direction in __flagged__ state (because `0 = up` changes to `2 = down`, `1 = right` goes to `3 = left`)

When the result of adding the value to `facing` goes outside `0..3` range, bitwise masking (`& 3`) corrects the value, fixing all boundary problems. It is worth mentioning that this expression fits perfectly to rules of both parts of the puzzle.


Next operation - updating `infection_status` of the node:
```C++
		infection_status = (infection_status + (part ^ 3)) & 3;
```

is as simple as adding `2` to `infection_status` for part one of the puzzle or adding `1` to `infection_status` for part two of the puzzle, which is handled by this part of the expression: `infection_status + (part ^ 3)`. Then, masking `& 3` keeps the result in requested `0..3` range.

Finally, the new `infection_status` value is stored in the node where virus carrier is positioned:

```C++
		_map[carrier] = infection_status;
```

and the carrier position is updating according to `facing` value:

```C++
		carrier.x += acc_x[facing];
		carrier.y += acc_y[facing];
```

with use of these acceleration arrays:

```C++
	static vector<int> acc_x = { 0, 1, 0, -1 };
	static vector<int> acc_y = { -1, 0, 1, 0 };
```

which move carrier:
- __up__ = vector (0,-1) when `facing == 0`,
- __right__ = vector (1,0) when `facing == 1`,
- __down__ = vector (0,1) when `facing == 2`
- __left__ = vector (-1,0) when `facing == 3`.


Nice, isn't it? :-)

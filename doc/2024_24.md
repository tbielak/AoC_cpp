## 2024/24 solution explained

AoC Puzzle: [`Crossed Wires`](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24)

Solution source code: [`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2024/2024_24.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2024/2024_24.h)

-----------------

Let's start with easy __part one__.

I propose the following class repesenting device:

```C++
class Device
{
public:
	Device(const vector<string>& input);
	Device& simulate();
	int64_t z_wires_output();

private:
	map<string, int> _wires;
	vector<vector<string>> _gates;

	void add_wire(const string& name, int value = UNDEFINED);
};
```

Constructor should load input and create `_wires` and `_gates`. Wires are kept in the map with the key being wire name and the integer value: `0` or `1` or `-1` when the value of wire is undefined. Gates are kept in vector. Each vector element is also a vector of four elements (_strings_): gate first input, gate type, gate second input, and gate output. Let's introduce constants which are indexes to the vector and the constant indicating undefined gate value:

```C++
constexpr auto INPUT1 = 0;
constexpr auto TYPE = 1;
constexpr auto INPUT2 = 2;
constexpr auto OUTPUT = 3;
constexpr auto UNDEFINED = -1;
```

Constructor loading data from input looks like this:

```C++
Device::Device(const vector<string>& input)
{
	size_t i = 0;
	for (; !input[i].empty(); i++)
		add_wire(input[i].substr(0, 3), stoi(input[i].substr(5)));

	smatch matches;
	regex regex("([0-9a-z]*) ([A-Z]*) ([0-9a-z]*) -> ([0-9a-z]*)");
	for (++i; i < input.size(); i++)
	{
		regex_search(input[i], matches, regex);
		_gates.push_back(vector<string>({ matches[1], matches[2], matches[3], matches[4] }));
		add_wire(matches[1]);
		add_wire(matches[3]);
		add_wire(matches[4]);
	}
}
```

...and uses `add_wire` method which adds a wire to the map (if not exists) with known value or with undefined value, if not specified:

```C++
void Device::add_wire(const string& name, int value /* = UNDEFINED */)
{
	if (_wires.find(name) == _wires.end())
		_wires[name] = value;
}
```

Now we need to simulate the operation of all gates to determine wires values. We will iterate through all the gates trying to determine the value of gate output, which is possible when both inputs are already known. We need to repeat these iterations until all outputs are defined. Here is the simulation loop:

```C++
Device& Device::simulate()
{
	while (1)
	{
		bool all_defined = true;
		for (auto& gate : _gates)
		{
			int& output = _wires.find(gate[OUTPUT])->second;
			if (output != UNDEFINED)
				continue;

			int v1 = _wires.find(gate[INPUT1])->second;
			int v2 = _wires.find(gate[INPUT2])->second;
			if (v1 == UNDEFINED || v2 == UNDEFINED)
			{
				all_defined = false;
				continue;
			}

			if (gate[TYPE] == "AND") output = v1 & v2; else
				if (gate[TYPE] == "XOR") output = v1 ^ v2; else
					if (gate[TYPE] == "OR") output = v1 | v2;
		}

		if (all_defined)
			break;
	}

	return *this;
}
```

And here is the answer for the question of _part one_:

>What decimal number does the system output on the wires starting with z?

```C++
int64_t Device::z_wires_output()
{
	int64_t v = 0;
	int64_t m = 1;
	for (const auto& [name, value] : _wires)
		if (name[0] == 'z')
		{
			v += m * value;
			m *= 2;
		}

	return v;
}
```

Let's call everything in proper order:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return Device(input).simulate().z_wires_output();
}
```

__Part one__ is solved.

-------------------------

In __part two__ we learn that the device is designed to add two binary numbers set on `x` and `y` wires, and the result should be in `z` wires, but due to some wire swaps, which we need to find, the result of operation is incorrect.

Let's take a look at input. There are 45 `x` wires (`x00-x44`), 45 `y` wires (`y00-y44`) and 46 `z` wires (`z00-z45`). It means we're adding two 45-bit numbers and the result is 46-bit number. So far so good.

But how is it done? Let's prepare and run the code which shows how the values of subsequent `z` wires are determined, starting from `z00`, ending with `z45`. To do this we initially set values of all wires to `UNDEFINED`. Then, in the `i` loop `i=0..45`, we set the value of `xi` and `yi` and try to determine values of as many wires as possible to see which wires are involved in processing `zi`. See the code:

```C++
void Device::show_order()
{
	for (auto& [_, w] : _wires)
		w = UNDEFINED;

	for (int i = 0; i < 45; i++)
	{
		string n = i > 9 ? to_string(i) : "0" + to_string(i);
		_wires["x" + n] = 1;
		_wires["y" + n] = 1;

		bool anything;
		do
		{
			anything = false;
			for (auto& gate : _gates)
			{
				int& a = _wires.find(gate[INPUT1])->second;
				int& b = _wires.find(gate[INPUT2])->second;
				int& c = _wires.find(gate[OUTPUT])->second;
				if (a != UNDEFINED && b != UNDEFINED && c == UNDEFINED)
				{
					cout << gate[0] << " " << gate[1] << " " << gate[2] << " -> " << gate[3] << endl;
					c = 1;
					anything = true;
				}
			}
		} while (anything);

		cout << "----" << endl;
	}
}
```

The print out is interesting. See the beginning:

```
y00 AND x00 -> gwq
x00 XOR y00 -> z00
----
y01 XOR x01 -> qgt
qgt XOR gwq -> z01
qgt AND gwq -> cgt
y01 AND x01 -> pvw
pvw OR cgt -> mct
----
y02 XOR x02 -> wvk
x02 AND y02 -> pcq
mct XOR wvk -> z02
wvk AND mct -> mtb
pcq OR mtb -> vgc
----
```

There are two gates related to `z00` and five gates related to every other `z` wire. We've got `2 + 5 * 44 = 222` wires in input. Two gates related to `z00` are XOR and AND, all five-gates sets related to other `z` wires include two XOR, two AND and one OR gate.

Let's order the arguments placing `xi` as first input `yi` as second input, and order five-gates sets to XOR/AND/XOR/AND/OR sequence:

```
x00 XOR y00 -> z00
x00 AND y00 -> gwq
----
x01 XOR y01 -> qgt
x01 AND y01 -> pvw
qgt XOR gwq -> z01
qgt AND gwq -> cgt
pvw OR cgt -> mct
----
x02 XOR y02 -> wvk
x02 AND y02 -> pcq
wvk XOR mct -> z02
wvk AND mct -> mtb
pcq OR mtb -> vgc
----
```

Let's analyze two gates in first group, related to least significant bit of addition, bit #0:
- The first gate `x00 XOR y00 -> z00` adds bits #0 of `x` and `y` and stores the result in bit #0 of `z`.
- The second gate `x00 AND y00 -> gwq` checks if there was a carry on addition of bits #0. The carry flag is put in output wire `gwq`.

Let's analyze group of five gates, related to bit #1:
- 1st gate `x01 XOR y01 -> qgt` adds bits #1 of `x` and `y`. The result is not yet stored in `z` because we may have a carry from addition of bits #0. So the result is stored in additional `qgt` wire.
- 2nd gate `x01 AND y01 -> pvw` checks if there was a carry on addition of bits #1. The carry flag is put in additional wire `pvw`.
- 3rd gate `qgt XOR gwq -> z01` determines the value of bit #1 of `z` by adding the result of addition of bits #1 of `x` and `y` and the value of carry flag from addition of bits #0.
- 4th gate `qgt AND gwq -> cgt` checks the carry flag of last addition and stores its value in additional `cgt` wire.
- 5th gate `pvw OR cgt -> mct` prepares the value of carry flag for addition of bits #2 (it is used by next five-gates sequence related to bit #2) by ORing two carries obtained in this group.

The relationships between the wires of the five gates related to the bit #2 are analogous to the relationships between the wires of the five gates related to the bit #1. And, if we want to obtain correct result of addition in `z`, every next five-gates set should follow the same pattern.

Let's see the correct pattern on the schema:

![Schema of adding numbers using XOR/AND/OR gates](2024_24.svg "Adding numbers using XOR/AND/OR gates")

For bit #0 gate `A` performs the addition (XOR gate), and gate `B` detects carry from this addition.

For next bits gates `A` and `C` perform addition of bits (XOR gates), gates `B` and `D` detect carry from additions (AND gates), and gate `E` propagates the carry flag to the next bit.

-------------------------

Well, in __part two__ we need to find __eight output wires swapped__. We need to check if outputs of the gates are correctly connected to the inputs of the other gates.

I solved my input __by hand__ on paper (naaaah, in notepad :), and saw only two kinds of flaws:
- incorrect input of gate `C` (output from gate `B` was connected to gate `C` instead of output from gate `A`),
- incorrect output of gate `C` (should lead to `z`, was leading to some other wire).

Let's prepare the code which solves it.

__Note:__ The solution presented below may not solve all inputs. It works correctly on mine input, and is general enough to solve inputs of other people, as long as these inputs have no other flaws introduced.

First: a skeleton of the loop which will checks the bits:

```C++
int bit = 1;
while (bit < 45)
{
	string n = bit > 9 ? to_string(bit) : "0" + to_string(bit);
	string x = "x" + n;
	string y = "y" + n;
	string z = "z" + n;

	// do something here

	bit++;
}
```

We'are starting from bit #1, because handling of bit #0 is different from handling next bits. And bit #0 is calculated correctly. Thus the only task related to bit #0 is finding `carry` wire, which is and output of `x00 AND y00` gate:

```C++
string carry = find_output("x00", "AND", "y00");
```

We're finding wires using `find_output` method:

```C++
string Device::find_output(const string& a, const string& type, const string& b) const
{
	for (const auto& gate : _gates)
		if ((gate[INPUT1] == a && gate[TYPE] == type && gate[INPUT2] == b) ||
			(gate[INPUT1] == b && gate[TYPE] == type && gate[INPUT2] == a))
			return gate[OUTPUT];

	return string();
}
```

Method `find_output` returns name of the output wire of the gate speficied by two inputs and type, or an empty string when such gate was not found in input.

We assume that `x00 AND y00` is defined in input, so the `carry` variable has the name of carry wire now. We also assume that we'll always find outputs of `A` and `B` gates for every next `i-th` bit (at least I checked it manually in my input). Let's add it to the loop. The code looks now like this:

```C++
string carry = find_output("x00", "AND", "y00");
int bit = 1;
while (bit < 45)
{
	string n = bit > 9 ? to_string(bit) : "0" + to_string(bit);
	string x = "x" + n;
	string y = "y" + n;
	string z = "z" + n;

	string A_output = find_output(x, "XOR", y);
	string B_output = find_output(x, "AND", y);

	// to do: some checks
	// to do: trace carry for next bits

	bit++;
}
```

Now we should check if we can find the output of `C` gate:

```C++
string C_output = find_output(A_output, "XOR", carry);
```

Empty string indicates that there is no XOR gate with inputs `A_output` and `carry`. In such case we can assume that `A_output` was swapped with the other output in the same set. The only output we've got so far is `B_output`. Let's try to swap these outputs and check again gates for this bit (by skipping `bit++` instruction):

```C++
while (bit < 45)
{
	...
	string A_output = find_output(x, "XOR", y);
	string B_output = find_output(x, "AND", y);

	string C_output = find_output(A_output, "XOR", carry);
	if (C_output.empty())
	{
		swap_outputs(A_output, B_output);
		continue;
	}

	// to do: more checks
	// to do: trace carry for next bits

	bit++;
}
```

We're using the following `swap_outputs` method:

```C++
void Device::swap_outputs(const string& a, const string& b)
{
	_swapped.insert(a);
	_swapped.insert(b);

	for (auto& gate : _gates)
	{
		if (gate[OUTPUT] == a)
			gate[OUTPUT] = b;
		else
			if (gate[OUTPUT] == b)
				gate[OUTPUT] = a;
	}
}
```

It does the swap, and it also registers wires which were swapped in `_swapped` class member defined as:

```C++
set<string> _swapped;
```

The next thing we check is if `C_output` is `z`. If not, `C_output` and `z` should be swapped:

```C++
while (bit < 45)
{
	...
	if (C_output != z)
	{
		swap_outputs(C_output, z);
		continue;
	}
	
	// to do: trace carry for next bits

	bit++;
}
```

That's all what is needed for my input (and, hopefully, for inputs of the other people). To complete the code we need to trace the carry wire:

```C++
while (bit < 45)
{
	...
	string D_output = find_output(A_output, "AND", carry);
	carry = find_output(B_output, "OR", D_output);
	bit++;
}
```

Finally, we create the result of __part two__ by joining already sorted names of swapped wires. Let's put the whole code into `eight_wires` method:

```C++
string Device::eight_wires()
{
	string carry = find_output("x00", "AND", "y00");
	int bit = 1;
	while (bit < 45)
	{
		string n = bit > 9 ? to_string(bit) : "0" + to_string(bit);
		string x = "x" + n;
		string y = "y" + n;
		string z = "z" + n;

		string A_output = find_output(x, "XOR", y);
		string B_output = find_output(x, "AND", y);

		string C_output = find_output(A_output, "XOR", carry);
		if (C_output.empty())
		{
			swap_outputs(A_output, B_output);
			continue;
		}

		if (C_output != z)
		{
			swap_outputs(C_output, z);
			continue;
		}

		string D_output = find_output(A_output, "AND", carry);
		carry = find_output(B_output, "OR", D_output);
		bit++;
	}

	string result;
	for (const string& s : _swapped)
	{
		if (!result.empty())
			result += ",";

		result += s;
	}

	return result;
}
```

And call it:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_two(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return Device(input).eight_wires();
}
```

Done! :-)

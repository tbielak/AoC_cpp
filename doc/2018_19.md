## 2018/19 solution explained

AoC Puzzle: [`Go With The Flow`](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/19)

Solution source code: [`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_19.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_19.h)

-----------------

We've got a device which has six registers, understands 16 opcodes, and runs a mysterious program, delivered from puzzle input.

__First part__ of the puzzle can be solved by taking excerpts of source code already written for 2018/16 ([`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_16.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_16.h)) + writting some additional code. Let's do this!

Device executes instructions composed of four numbers: __opcode__, __source_A__, __source_B__, __target__. Registers are also holding numbers. Let's use vector of ints in both cases:

```C++
typedef vector<int> t_instruction;
typedef vector<int> t_registers;
```

Execution of single instruction is already implemented in solution 2018/16. We will use here slightly modified version of it, with `code[0]` acting as __opcode__. We will also use new types defined above:
```C++
void Main::execute(t_registers& regs, const t_instruction& code)
{
	switch (code[0])
	{
		case 0: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] + regs[code[2]]; break; // addr
		case 1: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] + code[2]; break; // addi
		case 2: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] * regs[code[2]]; break; // mulr
		case 3: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] * code[2]; break; // muli
		case 4: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] & regs[code[2]]; break; // banr
		case 5: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] & code[2]; break; // bani
		case 6: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] | regs[code[2]]; break; // borr
		case 7: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] | code[2]; break; // bori
		case 8: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]]; break; // setr
		case 9: regs[code[3]] = code[1]; break; // seti
		case 10: regs[code[3]] = code[1] > regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtir
		case 11: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] > code[2] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtri
		case 12: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] > regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtrr
		case 13: regs[code[3]] = code[1] == regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqir
		case 14: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] == code[2] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqri
		default: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] == regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqrr
	}
}
```

Parsing instruction from a single line of input file requires finding __opcode__ corresponding to mnemonic provided on input (static map `opcodes` is used to do that) and reading __source_A__, __source_B__ and __target__ instruction arguments. __opcode__ is stored in `code[0]`, arguments in `code[1]`, `code[2]` and `code[3]`:

```C++
t_instruction Main::parse(const string& input)
{
	static map<string, int> opcodes =
	{ {"addr", 0}, {"addi", 1}, {"mulr", 2}, {"muli", 3}, {"banr", 4}, {"bani", 5}, {"borr", 6}, {"bori", 7},
	  {"setr", 8}, {"seti", 9}, {"gtir", 10}, {"gtri", 11}, {"gtrr", 12}, {"eqir", 13}, {"eqri", 14}, {"eqrr", 15} };

	t_instruction code = t_instruction(4);
	code[0] = opcodes[input.substr(0, 4)];
	stringstream ss(input.substr(5));
	for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
	{
		ss >> code[i];
		ss.ignore(1);
	}

	return code;
}
```

Loading input is as simple as parsing instructions from the file and placing them in `program` variable. Line starting with `#` indicates which register is used as instruction pointer - see `ip_reg` variable. `load` returns `ip_reg` and `program`:

```C++
pair<int, vector<t_instruction>> Main::load(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int ip_reg = 0;
	vector<t_instruction> program;
	for (const auto& s : input)
	{
		if (s[0] == '#')
			ip_reg = stoi(s.substr(4));
		else
			program.push_back(parse(s));
	}

	return make_pair(ip_reg, program);
}
```

To execute the program we need registers (`regs`) and execute instructions pointed by instruction pointer (`regs[ip_reg]`). When instruction pointer goes out of scope of instructions defined, execution is halted (`break;`) and the value of `reg[0]` is returned as solution of first part of the puzzle:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	auto [ip_reg, program] = load(input);
	t_registers regs = t_registers(6, 0);

	while (1)
	{
		int ip = regs[ip_reg];
		if (ip < 0 || ip >= (int)program.size())
			break;

		execute(regs, program[ip]);
		regs[ip_reg]++;
	}

	return regs[0];
}
```

To solve __part two__ of the puzzle we should set `reg[0]` to `1` before executing the program. Unfortunatelly, in such case the execution seems to be __running infinitely__. We need to analyse the program provided on input.

-----------------

Here is the program from my input:

```
#ip 3
addi 3 16 3
seti 1 3 1
seti 1 2 4
mulr 1 4 5
eqrr 5 2 5
addr 5 3 3
addi 3 1 3
addr 1 0 0
addi 4 1 4
gtrr 4 2 5
addr 3 5 3
seti 2 6 3
addi 1 1 1
gtrr 1 2 5
addr 5 3 3
seti 1 0 3
mulr 3 3 3
addi 2 2 2
mulr 2 2 2
mulr 3 2 2
muli 2 11 2
addi 5 8 5
mulr 5 3 5
addi 5 6 5
addr 2 5 2
addr 3 0 3
seti 0 5 3
setr 3 0 5
mulr 5 3 5
addr 3 5 5
mulr 3 5 5
muli 5 14 5
mulr 5 3 5
addr 2 5 2
seti 0 8 0
seti 0 9 3
```

Let's rewrite it in format `<instruction_number>: <pseudocode> ; <original_instruction>`. Pseudocode is C/C++ instruction equivalent where `R0`..`R5` are used as register names. Additionally `IP` is used in place of `R3`, because instruction pointer is bound to register number 3:

```
0:   IP += 16                  ; addi 3 16 3
1:   R1 = 1                    ; seti 1 3 1 
2:   R4 = 1                    ; seti 1 2 4
3:   R5 = R1 * R4              ; mulr 1 4 5
4:   R5 = (R5 == R2) ? 1 : 0   ; eqrr 5 2 5
5:   IP += R5                  ; addr 5 3 3
6:   IP++                      ; addi 3 1 3
7:   R0 += R1                  ; addr 1 0 0
8:   R4++                      ; addi 4 1 4
9:   R5 = (R4 > R2) ? 1 : 0    ; gtrr 4 2 5
10:  IP += R5                  ; addr 3 5 3
11:  IP = 2                    ; seti 2 6 3
12:  R1++                      ; addi 1 1 1
13:  R5 = (R1 > R2) ? 1 : 0    ; gtrr 1 2 5
14:  IP += R5                  ; addr 5 3 3
15:  IP = 1                    ; seti 1 0 3
16:  IP *= IP                  ; mulr 3 3 3
17:  R2 += 2                   ; addi 2 2 2
18:  R2 *= R2                  ; mulr 2 2 2
19:  R2 *= IP                  ; mulr 3 2 2
20:  R2 *= 11                  ; muli 2 11 2
21:  R5 += 8                   ; addi 5 8 5
22:  R5 *= IP                  ; mulr 5 3 5
23:  R5 += 6                   ; addi 5 6 5
24:  R2 += R5                  ; addr 2 5 2
25:  IP += R0                  ; addr 3 0 3
26:  IP = 0                    ; seti 0 5 3
27:  R5 = IP                   ; setr 3 0 5
28:  R5 *= IP                  ; mulr 5 3 5
29:  R5 += IP                  ; addr 3 5 5
30:  R5 *= IP                  ; mulr 3 5 5
31:  R5 *= 14                  ; muli 5 14 5
32:  R5 *= IP                  ; mulr 5 3 5
33:  R2 += R5                  ; addr 2 5 2
34:  R0 = 0                    ; seti 0 8 0
35:  IP = 0                    ; seti 0 9 3
```

We are starting execution from 0th instruction (`IP == 0`), which adds `16` to `IP`. Executing any instruction increases `IP` by one, so 0th instruction means `goto 17` (go to instruction 17th). Instructions 17-20 calculate value of register `R2`, instructions 21-23 calculate value of register `R5`, value of `R5` is added to `R2` in instruction 24. Finally `R2 == 1018` for my input.

Now, the value of `R0` is checked in fancy way: if `R0 == 0` (__first part__ of puzzle) then instruction 25 does nothing and instruction 26 is executed, meaning `goto 1`; if `R0 == 1` (__part two__ of the puzzle) then instruction 26 is skipped and instructions 27-34 are executed before `goto 1` in instruction 35.

Instructions 27-32 calculate new value of `R5`, which is added to `R2` by instruction 33. Finally `R2 == 10551418` for my input. Before `goto 1` register `R0` is set to zero (instruction 34):

```
0:      goto 17
1-16:   <some_code>
17-20:  R2 = 836               ; = 2 * 2 * 19 * 11
21-23:  R5 = 182               ; = 8 * 22 + 6
24:     R2 = 1018              ; = 836 + 1018
25-26:  if (R0 == 0) goto 1    ; jump if solving part one
27-32:  R5 = 10550400          ; = (27 * 28 + 29) * 30 * 14 * 32
33:     R2 = 10551418          ; = 10550400 + 1018
34:     R0 = 0
35:     goto 1
```

Observations/conclusions, so far:
- instructions 1-16 must calculate something basing on `R2` as input;
- `R2` value is much lower for __first part__ of the puzzle than value for __part two__ of the puzzle;
- in both cases (both parts of the puzzle) `R0 == 0` when entering block of instructions 1-16;
- current value of `IP` is used as source of many calculations (e.g. 28-30), there are also immediate numbers provided in some instructions (21, 23, 31).

Let's focus on instructions 1-16 now:

```
1:   R1 = 1                    ; seti 1 3 1 
2:   R4 = 1                    ; seti 1 2 4
3:   R5 = R1 * R4              ; mulr 1 4 5
4:   R5 = (R5 == R2) ? 1 : 0   ; eqrr 5 2 5
5:   IP += R5                  ; addr 5 3 3
6:   IP++                      ; addi 3 1 3
7:   R0 += R1                  ; addr 1 0 0
8:   R4++                      ; addi 4 1 4
9:   R5 = (R4 > R2) ? 1 : 0    ; gtrr 4 2 5
10:  IP += R5                  ; addr 3 5 3
11:  IP = 2                    ; seti 2 6 3
12:  R1++                      ; addi 1 1 1
13:  R5 = (R1 > R2) ? 1 : 0    ; gtrr 1 2 5
14:  IP += R5                  ; addr 5 3 3
15:  IP = 1                    ; seti 1 0 3
16:  IP *= IP                  ; mulr 3 3 3
```

Registers `R1` and `R4` are initialized with `1` (instructions 1-2). Both registers will be incremented later (instructions 8 and 12) and checked against `R2` (instructions 9 and 13). Depending on result, some jumps would be made, because `IP` changes after comparisons. We will analyse it more carefully, but it seems that `R1` and `R4` are some loop counters (`R1` for outer loop, `R4` for inner loop).

Instruction 3, which is probably inside both loops, calculates `R5 = R1 * R4` for various `R1` and `R4` values. Then, instruction 4 checks if `R5` equals `R2`. If `R5 == R2` then instruction 5 adds `1` to `IP` skipping instruction 6, which ends in adding `R1` value to `R0` by instruction 7. if `R5 != R2` then instruction 5 does nothing, so instruction 6 skips addition in instruction 7. Conclusion: instructions 4-7 do the following: `if (R5 == R2) R0 += R1`.

Similar jump-pattern is used in instructions 9-11, which perform `goto 3` if `R4 <= R2` and in instructions 13-15, which perform `goto 2` if `R1 <= R2`.

Instruction 16 is a fancy `halt`: `IP` value is multiplied by itself and stored in `IP`. Because it is instruction 16 resulting value is 256, which goes out of scope of instructions and halts executing the code:

```
1:      R1 = 1
2:      R4 = 1
3:      R5 = R1 * R4
4-7:    if (R5 == R2) R0 += R1
8:      R4++
9-11:   if (R4 <= R2) goto 3
12:     R1++
13-15:  if (R1 <= R2) goto 2
16:     halt
```

Code shown above can be transformed to the following C/C++ equivalent (execution starts with `R0 == 0` and `R2 = <input_value>`):

```C++
for (int R1 = 1; R1 <= R2; R1++)
{
	for (int R4 = 1; R4 <= R2; R4++)
	{
		int R5 = R1 * R4;
		if (R5 == R2)
			R0 += R1;
	}
}
```

Now it is obvious why __part two__ is calculating for ages: `R5` is calculated and compared against `R2` 10551418<sup>2</sup> times.

Let's eliminate `R5` to obtain final version of algorithm:

```C++
for (int R1 = 1; R1 <= R2; R1++)
	for (int R4 = 1; R4 <= R2; R4++)
		if (R1 * R4 == R2)
			R0 += R1;
```

-----------------

OK, but what __really__ does this algorithm?

`R0` holds a result. `R0` starts with `0` then some values of `R1` are added to `R0`. Conclusion: `R0` is a sum of some numbers from range `1..R2`.

Which numbers? These `R1` numbers which can be represented as `R1 * <something> == <input>`. Conclusion: set of numbers include all __factors__ of `<input>` number.

Let's test this discovery!

Number `1530` which is a result of __first part__ of the puzzle for my input was obtained for `R2 == 1018`. `1018` factors are: `{ 1, 2, 509, 1018 }`. If you run the above algorithm for `R2 == 1018` you'll see exactly these numbers in `R1` when adding to `R0`. So, result is `1 + 2 + 509 + 1018 = 1530`.

__Looks__ like the solution, __but__ there are various inputs for the puzzle! Hmmm...

-----------------

Let's __assume that every input__ obeys these rules:
- `ip_reg == 3` (always!);
- instruction 0 is `goto 17`;
- instructions 1-16 are always the same = algorithm mentioned above;
- instructions 17-... calculates value of `R2` and jumps to instruction 1.

Note: Above asumptions __looks fair__ for all AoC-puzzle-solvers to keep the same level of complexity for each of them.

Now, the plan for implementing the solution is:
- execute instructions from input to obtain `R2` value;
- halt execution when `IP == 1`;
- use faster substitute of algorithm stored originally in input instructions 1-16.

-----------------

__Final implementation...__

We're going to call `execute` method with input and starting value of `R0` register:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return execute(input, 0);
}

AoC::Output Main::part_two(const vector<string>& input)
{
	return execute(input, 1);
}
```

Prototype and execution plan for such method is:

```C++
int Main::execute(const vector<string>& input, int R0)
{
	// run initialization code, using R0, to find R2 value
	// find factors of R2 (excluding 1 and R2)
	// find set of R1 values
	// sum R1, return R0
}
```

Initialization code is executing input code up to the moment where `IP == 1`. It is implemented in this way:

```C++
auto [ip_reg, program] = load(input);
t_registers regs = t_registers(6, 0);
regs[0] = R0;

while (1)
{
	int ip = regs[ip_reg];
	if (ip == 1)
		break;

	execute(regs, program[ip]);
	regs[ip_reg]++;
}
```

Now we've got starting value of `R2` in `regs[2]`. Finding factors of `R2` (excluding `1` and `R2`) can be implemented as:

```C++
int n = regs[2];
vector<int> factors;
for (int k = 2; n > 1 && k * k <= n; k++)
	while (n % k == 0)
	{
		factors.push_back(k);
		n /= k;
	}

if (n > 1)
	factors.push_back(n);
```

While finding set of `R1` values we can use `std::set` and bit mask to generate all combinations of multiplications of factors:

```C++
set<int> R1;

int all = 1 << (int)factors.size();
for (int mask = 0; mask < all; mask++)
{
	int number = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)factors.size(); i++)
		if (mask & (1 << i))
			number *= factors[i];

	R1.insert(number);
}
```

Finally, sum of `R1` is as simple as:
```C++
return accumulate(R1.begin(), R1.end(), 0, [](int sum, const auto& v) { return sum + v; });
```

Done! :-)

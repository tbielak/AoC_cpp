## 2018/21 solution explained

AoC Puzzle: [`Chronal Conversion`](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/21)

Solution source code: [`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_21.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_21.h)

-----------------

Once again we've got a device which has six registers, understands 16 opcodes, and runs a mysterious program, delivered from puzzle input.

We already have pieces of source code, written for 2018/19 ([`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_19.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2018/2018_19.h)) almost ready to execute the program.

Let's take everything useful from 2018/19, first types:

```C++
typedef vector<int> t_instruction;
typedef vector<int> t_registers;
```

Then, method loading the program, returning number of IP register and vector of instructions:

```C++
pair<int, vector<t_instruction>> Main::load(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int ip = 0;
	vector<t_instruction> program;
	for (const auto& s : input)
	{
		if (s[0] == '#')
			ip = stoi(s.substr(4));
		else
			program.push_back(parse(s));
	}

	return make_pair(ip, program);
}
```

...which uses `parse` method to parse single line:

```C++
t_instruction Main::parse(const string& input)
{
	static map<string, int> opcodes =
	{ {"addr", 0}, {"addi", 1}, {"mulr", 2}, {"muli", 3}, {"banr", 4}, {"bani", 5}, {"borr", 6}, {"bori", 7},
	  {"setr", 8}, {"seti", 9}, {"gtir", 10}, {"gtri", 11}, {"gtrr", 12}, {"eqir", 13}, {"eqri", 14}, {"eqrr", 15} };

	t_instruction code = t_instruction(4);
	code[0] = opcodes[input.substr(0, 4)];
	stringstream ss(input.substr(5));
	for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
	{
		ss >> code[i];
		ss.ignore(1);
	}

	return code;
}
```

The following code is able to execute single instruction:

```C++
void Main::execute(t_registers& regs, const t_instruction& code)
{
	switch (code[0])
	{
		case 0: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] + regs[code[2]]; break; // addr
		case 1: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] + code[2]; break; // addi
		case 2: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] * regs[code[2]]; break; // mulr
		case 3: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] * code[2]; break; // muli
		case 4: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] & regs[code[2]]; break; // banr
		case 5: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] & code[2]; break; // bani
		case 6: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] | regs[code[2]]; break; // borr
		case 7: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] | code[2]; break; // bori
		case 8: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]]; break; // setr
		case 9: regs[code[3]] = code[1]; break; // seti
		case 10: regs[code[3]] = code[1] > regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtir
		case 11: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] > code[2] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtri
		case 12: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] > regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // gtrr
		case 13: regs[code[3]] = code[1] == regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqir
		case 14: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] == code[2] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqri
		default: regs[code[3]] = regs[code[1]] == regs[code[2]] ? 1 : 0; break; // eqrr
	}
}
```

We need to find the value of register 0, so let's make another `execute` method, which will execute the whole program with the value of register 0, passed in `R0` argument, and exits infinite loop when `ip` points outside the program:

```C++
void Main::execute(const vector<string>& input, int R0);
{
	auto [ip_reg, program] = load(input);
	t_registers regs = t_registers(6, 0);
	regs[0] = R0;

	while (1)
	{
		int ip = regs[ip_reg];
		if (ip < 0 || ip >= (int)program.size())
			break;

		execute(regs, program[ip]);
		regs[ip_reg]++;
	}
}
```

This is everything we can take from 2018/19 source code.

Since we need to find the lowest non-negative integer value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the fewest (__part one__) or the most (__part two__) instructions, let's try to call `execute` shown above with some numbers for `R0`. Of course program runs infinitely for many of them :)

We have to take a closer look at the mysterious program provided on input. Here's mine:

```
#ip 4
seti 123 0 3
bani 3 456 3
eqri 3 72 3
addr 3 4 4
seti 0 0 4
seti 0 5 3
bori 3 65536 5
seti 5557974 2 3
bani 5 255 2
addr 3 2 3
bani 3 16777215 3
muli 3 65899 3
bani 3 16777215 3
gtir 256 5 2
addr 2 4 4
addi 4 1 4
seti 27 9 4
seti 0 0 2
addi 2 1 1
muli 1 256 1
gtrr 1 5 1
addr 1 4 4
addi 4 1 4
seti 25 4 4
addi 2 1 2
seti 17 6 4
setr 2 2 5
seti 7 1 4
eqrr 3 0 2
addr 2 4 4
seti 5 7 4
```

Let's rewrite it in format `<instruction_number>: <pseudocode> ; <original_instruction>`. Pseudocode is C/C++ instruction equivalent where `R0`..`R5` are used as register names. Additionally `IP` is used in place of `R4`, because instruction pointer is bound to register number 4:

```
0:   R3 = 0x7B                    ; seti 123 0 3
1:   R3 &= 0x1C8                  ; bani 3 456 3
2:   R3 = (R3 == 0x48) ? 1 : 0    ; eqri 3 72 3
3:   IP += R3                     ; addr 3 4 4

5:   R3 = 0                       ; seti 0 5 3
6:   R5 = R3 | 0x10000            ; bori 3 65536 5
7:   R3 = 0x54CED6                ; seti 5557974 2 3
8:   R2 = R5 & 0xFF               ; bani 5 255 2
9:   R3 += R2                     ; addr 3 2 3
10:  R3 &= 0xFFFFFF               ; bani 3 16777215 3
11:  R3 *= 0x1016B                ; muli 3 65899 3
12:  R3 &= 0xFFFFFF               ; bani 3 16777215 3
13:  R2 = (0x100 > R5) ? 1 : 0    ; gtir 256 5 2
14:  IP += R2                     ; addr 2 4 4
15:  IP++                         ; addi 4 1 4
16:  IP = 27                      ; seti 27 9 4
17:  R2 = 0                       ; seti 0 0 2
18:  R1 = R2 + 1                  ; addi 2 1 1
19:  R1 *= 0x100                  ; muli 1 256 1
20:  R1 = (R1 > R5) ? 1 : 0       ; gtrr 1 5 1
21:  IP += R1                     ; addr 1 4 4
22:  IP++                         ; addi 4 1 4
23:  IP = 25                      ; seti 25 4 4
24:  R2++                         ; addi 2 1 2
25:  IP = 17                      ; seti 17 6 4
26:  R5 = R2                      ; setr 2 2 5
27:  IP = 7                       ; seti 7 1 4
28:  R2 = (R3 == R0) ? 1 : 0      ; eqrr 3 0 2
29:  IP += R2                     ; addr 2 4 4
30:  IP = 5                       ; seti 5 7 4

```

Setting new value to `IP` means jumping to another instruction. Setting and immediate value to `IP` is an unconditional jump - see `goto` instructions below. Modifying value of `IP` by adding the result of comparison is a conditional jump - see `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` below:

30:  IP = 5                       ; goto 6 ---------------/

```

It looks pretty complicated, but it is not. Let's take a look at the first loop:

```
0:   R3 = 0x7B                    ;
1:   R3 &= 0x1C8                  ;<----------\
2:   R3 = (R3 == 0x48) ? 1 : 0    ;           |
3:   IP += R3                     ; c1        |
4:   IP = 0                       ; goto 1 ---/
```

When `R3 == 0x48` then `R3` is set to `1` which is added to `IP` at `c1`, causing `IP = 0` instruction to be skipped. In other words: when `R3 == 0x48` we leave the loop, otherwise we `goto 1`.

__Note__: It seems that this piece of code is added just to illustrate this fact, because `0x7B & 0x1C8 = 0x48`, so we will exit from the loop in the first step, and never return here again.

--------------

The important code starts at fifth instruction. We see two loops:
- outer loop (instructions `6-30`)
- inner loop (instructions `8-27`), with a possibility to jump out to outer loop (`c2`) to instruction `28`:

```
5:   R3 = 0                       ;
6:   R5 = R3 | 0x10000            ; <---------------------\
7:   R3 = 0x54CED6                ;                       |
8:   R2 = R5 & 0xFF               ; <---------------\     |
...                               ;                 |     |
13:  R2 = (0x100 > R5) ? 1 : 0    ;                 |     |
14:  IP += R2                     ; c2              |     |
15:  IP++                         ;                 |     |
16:  IP = 27                      ; goto 28 --------+--\  |
...                               ;                 |  |  |
27:  IP = 7                       ; goto 8 ---------/  |  |
28:  R2 = (R3 == R0) ? 1 : 0      ; <------------------/  |
29:  IP += R2                     ; c4                    |
30:  IP = 5                       ; goto 6 ---------------/

```

Condition in instruction `28` is important for us, because we need to find some values for register 0 that cause the program to halt, and it is the only place in the program where value of `R0` is checked. `R0` is checked against `R3` and when these values are equal, `c4` causes setting IP to a value outside the address space, so the program halts. In other words: any value which is observed in `R3` at instruction `28` brings the program to halt. So, we can run the program with any value in `R0`, which causes to run the code infinitely (e.g. `R0 = 0`), and print out these values from `R3` when `IP = 28`.

Now, let's carefully read the question asked in __part one__:

>What is the [lowest non-negative integer] value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the fewest instructions?

The value of `R0` which causes the program to halt after executing the __fewest__ instructions is the __first__ value seen in `R3` when `IP = 28`. Note that the algorithm produces only non-negative 24-bit integer numbers (see `0xFFFFFF` masks) and the __first__ number found is __the only__ number with __the fewest__ instructions executed, so it is also the lowest, which fullfils requirements in brackets. We've got solution of __part one__!

What about __part two__?

>What is the [lowest non-negative integer] value for register 0 that causes the program to halt after executing the most instructions?

We can skip the part of the question in brackets, 'cause there will be __only one__ number for __the most__ instructions executed. Since we are asked to find this number, we can assume that the sequence of generated numbers will start repeating at some point, and the __last one__ found in the first cycle is the solution of __part two__!

Let's prepare the appriopriate code solving the task for my input:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::both_parts(const vector<string>& input)
{
	auto [ip_reg, program] = load(input);
	t_registers regs = t_registers(6, 0);

	int p1 = -1;
	int p2 = -1;
	set<int> values;
	while (1)
	{
		int ip = regs[ip_reg];
		if (ip == 28)
		{
			if (p1 == -1)
				p1 = regs[3];
				
			if (values.find(regs[3]) != values.end())
				return make_pair(p1, p2);

			p2 = regs[3];
			values.insert(regs[3]);
		}

		execute(regs, program[ip]);
		regs[ip_reg]++;
	}
}
```

Yes, it works! `p1` and `p2` are the correct solution of __part one__ and __part two__.

But it has two flows:
- it is not generic (solves my input),
- it is extremly slow (takes 20+ seconds on my machine).

In order to address the first issue I analyzed inputs of several other people and found the following:
- Length of the code and the sequence of instructions are always the same.
- Register numbers change, including `IP` register, but the algorithm stays the same, e.g. registers `R3` and `R4` are swapped, but the code stays the same.
- Constants `0x100`, `0x10000`, `0x1016B`, `0xFFFFFF` do not change, the only number which is changed is the first argument of `seti` instruction in eighth line of input.

Let's change the solution to be able to find the place in the code where `eqrr` instruction is placed and which register is compared to `R0`:


```C++
AoC::Output Main::both_parts(const vector<string>& input)
{
	auto [ip_reg, program] = load(input);
	t_registers regs = t_registers(6, 0);

	int rn = -1;
	int eqrr = -1;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)program.size(); i++)
		if (program[i][0] == 15)	// eqrr has code 15
		{
			eqrr = i;
			rn = program[i][1];
		}

	int p1 = -1;
	int p2 = -1;
	set<int> values;
	while (1)
	{
		int ip = regs[ip_reg];
		if (ip == eqrr)
		{
			if (p1 == -1)
				p1 = regs[rn];

			if (values.find(regs[rn]) != values.end())
				return make_pair(p1, p2);

			p2 = regs[rn];
			values.insert(regs[rn]);
		}

		execute(regs, program[ip]);
		regs[ip_reg]++;
	}
} 
```

And this is more generic version of the solution, which should solve any input.

--------------

Finally, let's go with something completely different. Let's replace the code which solves my input with ugly `C/C++` code coming directly from manual translation from input to pseudocode:


```C++
AoC::Output Main::both_parts(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int p1 = -1;
	int p2 = -1;
	set<int> values;

	int R0 = 0;
	int R1 = 0;
	int R2 = 0;
	int R3 = 0;
	int R5 = 0;

	R3 = 0x7B;
L1:
	R3 &= 0x1C8;
	R3 = (R3 == 0x48) ? 1 : 0;
	if (R3 == 1) goto L5;
	goto L1;
L5:
	R3 = 0;
L6:
	R5 = R3 | 0x10000;
	R3 = 0x54CED6;
L8:
	R2 = R5 & 0xFF;
	R3 += R2;
	R3 &= 0xFFFFFF;
	R3 *= 0x1016B;
	R3 &= 0xFFFFFF;
	R2 = (0x100 > R5) ? 1 : 0;
	if (R2 == 1) goto L16;
	goto L17;
L16:
	goto L28;
L17:
	R2 = 0;
L18:
	R1 = R2 + 1;
	R1 *= 0x100;
	R1 = (R1 > R5) ? 1 : 0;
	if (R1 == 1) goto L23;
	goto L24;
L23:
	goto L26;
L24:
	R2++;
	goto L18;
L26:
	R5 = R2;
	goto L8;
L28:
	if (p1 == -1)
		p1 = R3;

	if (values.find(R3) != values.end())
		return make_pair(p1, p2);

	p2 = R3;
	values.insert(R3);

	R2 = (R3 == R0) ? 1 : 0;
	if (R2 == 1) goto end;
	goto L6;
end:;
}
```

It works! And it is executed at least __200 times faster__! But it is not generic, it doesn't even touch the input.

Let's check the code against the observations related to different inputs:
- Since length of the code and the sequence of instructions are always the same for different inputs, we're OK here.
- For different inputs register numbers change, including `IP` register, but the algorithm stays the same. We're not using registers here, just some variables which keep algorithm the same and there is no `IP` register, the flow is controlled by ugly `goto` instructions. So we're OK here too.
- For different inputs constants `0x100`, `0x10000`, `0x1016B`, `0xFFFFFF` do not change, the only number which is changed is the first argument of `seti` instruction in eight line of input. In my input it is the number `0x54CED6`, which can be replaced by `arg` variable, which value can be taken directly from the input by the code:

```C++
int arg = stoi(input[8].substr(5));
```

Now, the solution should be generic. Let's carefully tranform ugly code to something more readable, by:
- removing `goto` instructions,
- joining arithmetic operations,
- removing obsolete variables.

And... the final code looks now like this:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::both_parts(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int arg = stoi(input[8].substr(5));

	int p1 = -1;
	int p2 = -1;
	set<int> values;

	int R3 = 0;
	while (1)
	{
		int R5 = R3 | 0x10000;
		R3 = arg;
		while (1)
		{
			R3 += R5 & 0xFF;
			R3 = ((R3 & 0xFFFFFF) * 0x1016B) & 0xFFFFFF;
			if (R5 < 0x100)
				break;

			int R2 = 0;
			while ((R2 + 1) * 0x100 <= R5)
				R2++;

			R5 = R2;
		}
		
		if (p1 == -1)
			p1 = R3;

		if (values.find(R3) != values.end())
			return make_pair(p1, p2);

		p2 = R3;
		values.insert(R3);
	}
}
```

Done! :-)

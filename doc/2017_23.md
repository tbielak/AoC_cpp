## 2017/23 solution explained

We've got a virtual coprocessor which has eight registers, knows four instructions, and runs a mysterious program, delivered from puzzle input.

Part one of the puzzle is quite easy: you should take a CPU implemented in 2017/18 ([`.cpp`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2017/2017_18.cpp) [`.h`](https://github.com/tbielak/AoC_cpp/blob/master/sources/2017/2017_18.h)), modify it a bit, run the code, and obtain the result.

Quote from part one of the puzzle description:

>The coprocessor is currently set to some kind of __debug mode__, which allows for testing, but prevents it from doing any meaningful work.

Part two is much harder:

>Now, it's time to fix the problem.
>
>The debug mode switch is wired directly to register `a`. You flip the switch, which makes __register a now start at 1__ when the program is executed.
>
>Immediately, the coprocessor begins to overheat. Whoever wrote this program obviously didn't choose a very efficient implementation. You'll need to __optimize the program__ if it has any hope of completing before Santa needs that printer working.

When switching off the debug mode, the code seems to be running infinitely. Moreover:

>The coprocessor's ultimate goal is to determine the final value left in register h once the program completes. Technically, if it had that... it wouldn't even need to run the program.
>
>After setting register a to 1, if the program were to run to completion, __what value would be left in register h__?

Authors of the puzzle encourage us to __look at the source of the program__.

Let's go this path!

-----------------

My input looks like this assembly program (ASM):

```
set b 93
set c b
jnz a 2         ----+
jnz 1 5         ----|---+           (*)
mul b 100       <---+   |
sub b -100000           |
set c b                 |
sub c -17000            |
set f 1         <-------+ <-----+
set d 2                         |
set e 2         <-----------+   |
set g d         <-------+   |   |
mul g e                 |   |   |
sub g b                 |   |   |
jnz g 2         ----+   |   |   |
set f 0             |   |   |   |
sub e -1        <---+   |   |   |
set g e                 |   |   |
sub g b                 |   |   |
jnz g -8        --------+   |   |
sub d -1                    |   |
set g d                     |   |
sub g b                     |   |
jnz g -13       ------------+   |
jnz f 2                         |
sub h -1                        |
set g b                         |
sub g c                         |
jnz g 2         ----+           |
jnz 1 3         ----|---+       |   (*)
sub b -17       <---+   |       |
jnz 1 -23       --------|-------+
                        v
```

Four ASM instructions are used: __set__ (assignment), __sub__ (subtraction), __mul__ (multiplication) and __jnz__ (jump if not zero). Eight registers: `a` to `h` are used as instruction arguments, as well as integer immediate values (numbers).

I drawn arrows (`--->`) in listing above to show jump destination when __jnz__ condition is met. Two __jnz__ instructions marked as `(*)` are unconditional jumps, because the first argument is `1` which is always non-zero. All other jumps are taken when the appropriate register value is zero.

Let's transform ASM into C/C++ routine `program_one`, which has the following features:
- it takes value of register `a` as input (`a == 0` means __debug__ mode, `a == 1` means non-debug mode)
- it uses `mult` variable to count multiplications (the goal of first part of the puzzle)
- it uses block of C++ instructions (first `if`) to handle block of ASM instructions after two __jnz__ instructions coming one-by-one
- it uses C++ `if` whenever ASM instruction __jnz__ goes forward
- it uses C++ `while (1)` whenever ASM instruction __jnz__ goes backward, and `if` with `break` where the condition is not met

```C++
int program_one(int a)
{
        int mult = 0;
        int b = 93;                                     // set b 93
        int c = b;                                      // set c b
        if (a != 0)                                     // jnz a 2
        {                                               // jnz 1 5
                b *= 100;                               // mul b 100
                b += 100000;                            // sub b -100000
                c = b;                                  // set c b
                c += 17000;                             // sub c -17000
        }
		
        int g = 0;
        int h = 0;
        while (1)
        {
                int f = 1;                              // set f 1
                int d = 2;                              // set d 2
                while (1)
                {
                        int e = 2;                      // set e 2
                        while (1)
                        {
                                g = d;                  // set g d
                                g *= e;                 // mul g e
                                mult++;
                                g -= b;                 // sub g b
                                if (g == 0)             // jnz g 2
                                        f = 0;          // set f 0

                                e++;                    // sub e -1
                                g = e;                  // set g e
                                g -= b;                 // sub g b
                                if (g == 0)             // jnz g -8
                                        break;
                        }

                        d++;                            // sub d -1
                        g = d;                          // set g d
                        g -= b;                         // sub g b
                        if (g == 0)                     // jnz g -13
                                break;
                }

                if (f == 0)                             // jnz f 2
                        h++;                            // sub h -1

                g = b;                                  // set g b
                g -= c;                                 // sub g c
                if (g == 0)                             // jnz g 2
                        break;                          // jnz 1 3

                b += 17;                                // sub b -17
        }                                               // jnz 1 -23

        return mult;
}
```

Now, let's transform it a bit - to `program_two`, which:
- takes boolean `debug` variable to choose debug/non-debug mode and returns `mult` (multiplication count) or `h` (register value) depending on it
- joins simple separate instructions (assignment, subtraction, multiplication), where possible

```C++
int program_two(bool debug)
{
	int mult = 0;
	int b = 93;
	int c = b;
	if (!debug)
	{
		b = b * 100 + 100000;
		c = b + 17000;
	}

	int g = 0;
	int h = 0;
	while (1)
	{
		int f = 1;
		int d = 2;
		while (1)
		{
			int e = 2;
			while (1)
			{
				g = d * e - b;
				mult++;
				if (g == 0)
					f = 0;

				e++;
				g = e - b;
				if (g == 0)
					break;
			}

			d++;
			g = d - b;
			if (g == 0)
				break;
		}
			
		if (f == 0)
			h++;

		g = b - c;
		if (g == 0)
			break;

		b += 17;
	}

	return debug ? mult : h;
} 
```

Observation: `g` is used to compare values.

Explanation: In ASM there is no instruction to compare two values, so `g` register is always used to keep the result of subtraction of some values, and then __jnz__ with `g` as first argument is used to make a jump.

Take a look at this part of C/C++ equivalent code:

```C++
g = d - b;
if (g == 0)
	break;
```

It can be replaced by:

```C++
if (d == b)
	break;
```

eliminating `g` variable.

Let's do it in the whole program, which results in `program_three`:

```C++
int program_three(bool debug)
{
	int mult = 0;
	int b = 93;
	int c = b;
	if (!debug)
	{
		b = b * 100 + 100000;
		c = b + 17000;
	}

	int h = 0;
	while (1)
	{
		int f = 1;
		int d = 2;
		while (1)
		{
			int e = 2;
			while (1)
			{
				mult++;
				if (d * e == b)
					f = 0;

				e++;
				if (e == b)
					break;
			}

			d++;
			if (d == b)
				break;
		}

		if (f == 0)
			h++;

		if (b == c)
			break;

		b += 17;
	}

	return debug ? mult : h;
} 
```

Now, what can we do to replace these ugly `whiles` by something?!

In the most inner `while` loop value of the variable `e` is increased until it reaches value of variable `b`, which exits the loop, and `e` starts from `2`. The simpler equivalent for it is `for (int e = 2; e < b; e++)` loop. The same situation is with `d` variable in the middle loop. The most outer loop increases `b` by `17` and loops until it goes beyond value of `c`.

Now, take a look at the program with `for` instead of `while` - this is `program_four`:

```C++
int program_four(bool debug)
{
	int mult = 0;
	int b = 93;
	int c = b;
	if (!debug)
	{
		b = b * 100 + 100000;
		c = b + 17000;
	}

	int h = 0;
	for (; b <= c; b += 17)
	{
		int f = 1;
		for (int d = 2; d < b; d++)
			for (int e = 2; e < b; e++)
			{
				mult++;
				if (d * e == b)
					f = 0;
			}

		if (f == 0)
			h++;
	}

	return debug ? mult : h;
} 
```

Now it is so simple we can finally analyse it :)

In __debug mode__ (part one of the puzzle) `b` and `c` variables are set to `93`. In result: the outer `for` loop is executed __once__ and whatever is inside - it is executed on low number = __93__ (exit conditions of inner `for` loops are based on `b`).

In __non-debug mode__ (part two of the puzzle) `b` is multiplied by 100 and 100000 is added to `b`, `c` is greater than `b` by `17000`. The outer `for` loop will be executed __1001 times__ (because of what was stated before and because of `b <= c` condition and `b += 17` step) and whatever is inside - it is executed on higher numbers than in __debug mode__.

Looping __1001 times__ (instead of __once__) in outside loop cannot be the reason of long execution, I bet that bigger numbers in inner `for` loops make a problem.

-----------------

So... what happens here?

At first, take a look at `h` variable, which final value is the solution of part two of the puzzle. It is set to zero before the outer `for` loop, then the inner `for` loops check something and set `f` flag according to `d * e == b` result. All `b` numbers which has no `f` __feature__ are counted (`h++`):

```C++
int program_four(bool debug)
{
	...
	int h = 0;
	for (; b <= c; b += 17)
	{
		int f = 1;
		for (int d ...)
			for (int e ...)
			{
				if (d * e == b)
					f = 0;
			}

		if (f == 0)
			h++;
	}

	return debug ? mult : h;
} 
```

What is `f` __feature__?

Let's take a look at inner `for` loops:

```C++
		int f = 1;
		for (int d = 2; d < b; d++)
			for (int e = 2; e < b; e++)
			{
				mult++;
				if (d * e == b)
					f = 0;
			}
```

At the beginning it is assumed that `b` number has `f` __feature__ (`int f = 1`). Then `b` number is checked in inner `for` loops, and when `d * e == b` then the number has no `f` __feature__ (`f = 0`).

Both `d` and `e` start with `2` and go by one to `b`, excluding `b`. And we're checking if `d * e == b`. In other words: we're checking if the number can be divided with no reminder by any number other then `1` and the number itself (`b`). It is the condition for __prime numbers__. So... the inner `for` loops set `f` to zero if the number is __non-prime__! And these numbers are counted in `h` counter.

Looks like the solution of part two!

-----------------

__Stop!__

The main questions now are:
- What are the differences between various inputs to this puzzle?
- How generic the solution should be?

I __believe__ that the program remains almost the same for all *AoC-puzzle-solvers*. I __assume__ that only starting value of `b` can be changed for this puzzle. Hmm... numbers `17`, `17000`, `100` and `100000` could be changed also, but I __bet__ the authors of the puzzle changed `b` value only.

This assumption leads to the following final code of part one:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_one(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int b = stoi(input[0].substr(6));
	return (b - 2) * (b - 2);
} 
```

First line of the solution takes the `b` value from the input, the second line counts number of executions of __mul__ ASM instruction: `b - 2` is a result of checking all numbers from `2` to `b - 1`, and `(b - 2) * (b - 2)` is the result of two nested `for` loops.

The solution of part two is:

```C++
AoC::Output Main::part_two(const vector<string>& input)
{
	int b = stoi(input[0].substr(6)) * 100 + 100000;
	int c = b + 17000;
	auto sieve = sieveOfEratosthenes(c);

	int h = 0;
	for (; b <= c; b += 17)
		if (!sieve[b])
			h++;

	return h;
} 
```

Explanation:

Take `b` value from the input, calculate `c` value, find prime numbers up to `c` value using `sieveOfEratosthenes` algorithm. Using `h` count all the numbers which are not prime.

And for finding primes I used *sieve of Eratosthenes* algorithm:

```C++
vector<bool> Main::sieveOfEratosthenes(int n)
{
	vector<bool> sieve = vector<bool>(n + 1, true);
	for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++)
		if (sieve[i])
			for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
				sieve[j] = false;

	return sieve;
} 
```

It is basic common knowledge, so - no explanation here :-)
